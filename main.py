st.subheader('Introduction of the online application')
st.markdown('The online application was developed based on the highest performing model, the random forest. The model had an AUROC of 0.823 (95% CI: 0.757-0.889), Youden index of 1.571, and Brier score of 0.107. External validation also showed the AUROC could be up to 0.800 (95% CI: 0.688-0.912), Youden index was 1.637, and accuracy was up to 0.867. As expected, the prediction performance of the model also outperformed SOFA (AUROC: 0.631), OASIS (AUROC: 0.659), and SAPS II (AUROC: 0.578). ')

Patients who were classified into the high-risk group were slightly above 10-time more vulnerable to develop PerCI than those in the low-risk group in the internal validation cohort (P<0.001). Similar results were observed in the external validation cohort and the number was more than 3 times (P=0.001).')
